SecureCrypt is a Python-based encryption tool that allows you to **securely encrypt and decrypt files** using **Fernet (AES-128-CBC)**. It utilizes **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** for key derivation, ensuring **high security** to protect your files from unauthorized access.



## **üöÄ Key Features**

‚úÖ **Strong Encryption:** Uses **Fernet (AES-128-CBC)** for high-level security.

‚úÖ **Supports Various File Types:** Works with **.txt, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .sh, .py, .php, .html, .mp3, .mp4, .zip, .exe**, and more.

‚úÖ **Password Protection:** Files can only be decrypted with the correct password.

‚úÖ **Encrypted File Detection:** Automatically detects whether a file is already encrypted.

‚úÖ **Cross-Platform:** Runs on **Windows, Linux, and macOS** without additional modifications.

## **How to install**

> Note: Tested on Windows WSL/Linux/Termux

## **Installation on Windows WSL/Linux**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ilhamrzr/SecureCrypt
$ cd SecureCrypt
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py
```

### üì≤ Installation on Termux

> Note: Tested with python version 3.11.2 and pip version 23.0.1

1. Update & Upgrade Packages

   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   pkg install python python-pip python-cryptography openssl-tool
   ```

3. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ilhamrzr/SecureCrypt
   ```

4. Navigate to the SecureCrypt folder

   ```
   cd SecureCrypt
   ```

5. Edit `requirements.txt`

   Since `cryptography==44.0.1` is not compatible with Termux, remove it from `requirements.txt`.
   You can manually edit the file or use this command to delete it automatically:

   ```bash
   sed -i '/cryptography==44.0.1/d' requirements.txt
   ```

6. After removing `cryptography`, install the remaining dependencies with:

   ```bash
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Run SecureCrypt

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

‚ö† **Do not forget your password!** If lost, the file **cannot be decrypted**.

‚ö† **Do not encrypt files that are currently in use** (e.g., an open Excel file).

‚ö† **Make a backup before encrypting important files to avoid data loss.**
